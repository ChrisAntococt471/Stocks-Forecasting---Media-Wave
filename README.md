# Stocks-Forecasting---Media-Wave
## The project focused on predicting several stock prices so that we could know which stocks would have better profitability in the future for portfolio consideration.

## Problems:
What is the most profitable stock for 3 month?

What is the most profitable stock for 1 year?

What is the most profitable and safest stock for 5 year?


This project aimed to answer these questions by performing forecasting modeling on available stock price data using Prophet model.

## Findings

### What is the most profitable stock for 3 month?

The risk is measured by variance. High variance in a stock is associated with higher risk while low variance is associated with lower risk. The safest and most profitable stock for 5 year based on forecast model is **SRIL.** SRIL has a higher possible gain while having a lower variance than PWON.
